# Pneumococcal Cell Membrane Models

Coarse-grained (Martini 2.2) Molecular Dynamics Production Simulation files for pneumococcal membrane models grown with four different growth media:

1) **gal**:   Galactose
2) **glu**:   Glucose
3) **glu16**: Glucose + C16:0   (Palmitic Acid)
4) **glu18**: Glucose + C18:1n9 (Oleic Acid)

The raw lipidomic data was provided by the lab of A/Prof. Bart Eijkelkamp as Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia.

Publication pending.
